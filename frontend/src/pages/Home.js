                Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Scott and I am a fourth year computer science student at Dalhousie University.
                I am from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and went to Prince Andrew High School before attending Dalhousie. 
                I began programming in high school which led me to pursue a degree in computer science.
                Outside of programming and school I enjoy playing Hockey, Golf, Guitar, Video Games, and spending time with friends and family.
